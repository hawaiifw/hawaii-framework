The `hawaii-starter-logging` delivers a fully configured set of filters that are added to the filter chain in the configured order. The
starter contains a default configuration, which can be overridden by adding properties to your configuration. The default configuration
consists of the filters listed in the table below.

.Default filter configuration

|Filter|Enabled|Order|Additional properties
|kibana-log|true|4|-
|kibana-log-cleanup|true|2|-
|request-duration|true|3|-
|request-id|true|6|-
|request-response|true|7|
* fallbackToFile: write the response to a file if its size exceeds `maxLogSize`, default value is `true`
* directory: the directory where files are written to, defaults to `/tmp`
* maxLogSize: the maximum log size to write to the log, see `fallbackToFile`, default value is `50k`
* allowedContentTypes: For console logging, the allowed content types, empty means allow all. Default value:
** application/json
** text/plain
** text/xml

An example of the default configuration is available in <<appendix-hawaii-application-properties, the appendix>>.

==== How to use
In order to use Hawaii logging, you'll need to define an appender that uses the `KibanaLogEventEncoder`, for example:
```
    <appender name="kibana" class="ch.qos.logback.core.rolling.RollingFileAppender">
        <file>log/idm-kibana.log</file>
        <encoder class="org.hawaiiframework.logging.logback.KibanaLogEventEncoder"/>
        <rollingPolicy class="ch.qos.logback.core.rolling.TimeBasedRollingPolicy">
            <fileNamePattern>${tomcat_logs}/hawaii-idm.log.%d{yyyy-MM-dd}.gz</fileNamePattern>
            <maxHistory>10</maxHistory>
        </rollingPolicy>
    </appender>
```

The asynchronous request execution in Hawaii is built on top of the scheduling in Spring Framework, see the
http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/#scheduling-annotation-support[Spring documentation]
for a baseline explanation.

There are two main additions:

* More flexibility in executor configuration
* Task timeout

[[starters-hawaii-starter-async-executor-configuration]]
==== Executor configuration
The Hawaii async configuration allows the definition of executors. An executor can be viewed as a thread pool.
An executor configuration looks something like this:

    executors:
    -
        name: default
        corePoolSize: 10
        keepAliveTime: 60
        maxPendingRequests: 60
        maxPoolSize: 60

The lowest level of configuration is a task. Tasks are grouped into systems. A system could be some backend
system against which requests are executed, or a database on which queries are executed.
Each request or query represents a task in Hawaii async terminology. System and task configuration looks like this:

    systems:
      -
          name: mySystem
          defaultExecutor: myExecutor
          defaultTimeout: 3
          tasks:
            -
                method: myTask
                executor: mySpecialExecutor
                timeout: 1
            -
                method: myOtherTask

As can be seen, an executor can be assigned on system level. This will be the default executor for all the tasks in the system,
unless a specific executor is configured for a task, such as `myTask` in the example. The same mechanism applies to the timeout settings.
It is therefore perfectly legal to configure a task without any properties. However, it remains necessary to define the task
in the configuration, otherwise it can't be used, i.e. every task *must* be defined in the configuration.

Finally, there are some global properties:

    defaultExecutor: default
    defaultTimeout: 10
    asyncTimeoutExecutorPoolSize: 10

These define the default executor and timeout. These defaults will be used if no executor or timeout is defined on either task or system.

The `asyncTimeoutExecutorPoolSize` property defines the number of threads that are used to run timeout tasks.
See <<starters-hawaii-starter-async-task-timeout, task timeout>>.

[[starters-hawaii-starter-async-task-timeout]]
==== Task timeout
Another addition is automatically timing out tasks. For each task that is executed, the Hawaii async framework enqueues a
cancellation task into a separate executor. If the timeout moment arrives, the timeout task is executed and will attempt to abort the
actual task being executed. The actual task will remove the timeout task when it finishes, so if a task runs within its time limit,
the timeout task will never be run.

[[starters-hawaii-starter-async-usage]]
==== Usage
In practice, using the Hawaii asynchronous framework is not that different from using Spring's: asynchronous execution must be
enabled with `@EnableAsync` and methods that are to be executed asynchronously must be annotated with the `@Async` annotation,
and they must have a `Future` typed return value.

Additionally, an asynchronous configuration must be defined in the file identified by the `hawaii.async.configuration` property,
which is set to `./config/async-config.yml` by default.

The essential difference in usage is that where Spring allows the specification of an executor by specifying the value of the
`@Async` annotation, the Hawaii additions allow specifying the `Task` name instead of the executor. The Hawaii async configuration will
take care of routing the execution to the correct `Executor`.

[[starters-hawaii-starter-async-components]]
==== Components

The following diagram shows the various components in the Hawaii async solution:

image::./resources/images/hawaii-async-task-overview.png[]

In the diagram, MethodX is the call that must be executed asynchronously, for example service or repository method. The `@Async`
annotation causes Spring to create a proxy around this method. The proxy locates the executor, which in the Hawaii case is a
`DelegatingExecutor` which will delegate to the real executor specified for the task. The executor takes the `MethodX Runnable`
and executes it on an available thread.

Additionally, a delayed (by the configured timeout) task, the `MethodX Guard` is created and passed to the `Delayed Guard Executor`.

Both tasks share the `Shared Task Context` which allows them to share logging context, and which also provides access for the
guarded task to remove the guard task upon completion, and for the guard task to abort the guarded task upon activation.
